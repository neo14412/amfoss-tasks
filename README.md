a. Why we must choose you ?

Because I'll get any job done. You just need to name it. 
I may lack the knowledge or skill to accomplish a particular task, But I'll be sure as hell to work out a way to build up the knowledge and skill necessary to get the task done from scratch. I love the pursuit of knowledge and the fun of finding out things on my own. So I won't bother you guys with a lot of doubts or questions, and I'd rather find the answers to those questions myself. So you could say I'm an independent thinker and love problem solving.
For me,the tougher the probem,the greater will the joy and satisfaction in finding out the solution to it.
 But deep down I've always been a team player and always loved brainstorming and tinkering with a team of people. So being part of a team alwyas meant a lot to me.
 
 b. What is your plan for the next 6 months ?
 
 I'm looking forward to doing projects involving machine learning and ios/android app development.I hope to learn from the best to hone my skills and at the same    time, contribute to the club as musch as possible.
 
 c. How would you contribute back to the club ?
 
 I'll contribute to the club with one of the most precious things that anyone can ever give. I'll give you my TIME.
 I'll complete any task you throw at me no matter how long it takes nor how hard it is. Mainly I'll contribute to the clubs development in the applications of machine learning to solve a lot of everyday problems. I also plan to create an emergency sSOS system and app which can be linked to automobiles,which at the time of an accident it will automatically alert the healthcare facility by providing the right location and medical emergency. I also plan to make an app to report corruption in india, where the people get a chance to speak out the injustice. I also want to learn more about IoT devices and do some projects based on that too, especially on distater managemnt and defence related projects. I also have many more app ideas that I wish to do once I join the club.
 
 d. Do you have any feedback for the selection process ?
 
 Well, it's good so far and the people where mostly nice. In my opinion, the club could be a little bit less hostile to the new comers.
 Everything else is fine and dandy.
